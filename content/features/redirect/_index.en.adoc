The UNICEF Inventory theme includes a feature that allows you to redirect the user to another website.
Sometimes, a page hosted in your site is moved to another website.
While Hugo allows you to create https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#aliases[aliases] that redirects one page to another in the same site, it is not possible to redirect a page to an external site.
These *page redirects* solve that problem.

To create a page redirect, define the layout `type` and `redirectUrl` in the page front-matter:

{{< highlight yaml >}}
---
title: UNICEF Office of Innovation
description: The Office of Innovation uses technology to address the biggest challenges facing children today.
type: redirect
redirectUrl: https://www.unicef.org/innovation/

---
{{< /highlight >}}

When the user visits this page on the Hugo site, they are redirected to the `unicef.org` website after a five-second pause.
